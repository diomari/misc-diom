  <!-- <h2>About</h2> -->
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I started out as a front-end developer learning the fundamentals of HTML, Javascript and CSS. Years went by I decided to learn more and really understand how things on the web work. I then continued experimenting things with server-side languages. I've tried quite few of them but there's one language that truly struck my heart and that is Python. For me Python alongside with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> hit the right balance between being fun and productive. I highly suggest it to anyone who wants to try a new framework.</p>
<p>My goal right now is to deepen my knowledge both on backend and frontend development. I'm aware that the road to become a true developer is long and daunting but with the right mindset and perseverance we will eventually get there.</p>
<h3>Why I started this blog</h3>
<p>The primary goal is to make this an archive of the things I've learned doing web development. Hopefully you may find some things helpful. This blog is powered by <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/" title="Lektor">Lektor</a> a static site generator and its hosted on <a href="https://www.github.com/diomari">github</a>. Feel free to drop suggestions, if you want to colaborate or want to keep in touch my email is <code>diom.dev(at)gmail.com</code></p>
<p><code>Happy Coding :)</code></p>
